Web development is my playground and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my building blocks. I've been a self-taught wizard in this realm for quite some time now and have dabbled in the mystical powers of Bootstrap, React, and MongoDB. I'm also a proud member of the Grand Rapids Web Development Group where I share my coding joy with others. When I'm not conjuring up new creations, you'll find me on my bike, diving into the depths of the ocean with my shark friends, tending to my buzzing bee friends, or baking up a storm in the kitchen.
